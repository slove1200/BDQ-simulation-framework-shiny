# Bedaquiline Dose-PK-Efficacy/Safety-Outcome Modelling Framework

## Overview
**This repository contains a Shiny application, which provides an interactive modelling framework for pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy (time-to-positivity), safety (QT interval), and long-term treatment outcomes of bedaquiline to help explore and visualize different bedaquiline dosing options.**

The application incorporates several established models:
- Pharmacokinetic (PK) model developed by [Svensson et al. (*CPT: PSP*, 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1002/psp4.12147)
- PK-efficacy models developed by [Svensson and Karlsson (*J Antimicrob Chemother*, 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1093/jac/dkx317) and Tanneau et al. [(*Br J Clin Pharmacol*, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1111/bcp.14199)
- PK-safety model developed by [Tanneau et al. (*CPT: PSP*, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1002/psp4.12722)
- Long-term outcome model developed by [Lin et al. (*J Antimicrob Chemother*, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1093/jac/dkae256)

For the effect of concomitant medications on PK and QT level, the parameters from the publications listed are incorporated:

-...

Additionally, the application includes a dedicated time-to-positivity (TTP) simulation module using the abovementioned two PK-efficacy models that allows users to generate individual time-to-positivity profiles without considering individual drug exposure but focusing on the overall combination therapy effect, as described by the half-life of mycobacterial load modifier. This module enables further analysis of TTP data and visualization of time-to-sputum culture conversion (TSCC).

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main components:

### BDQ_Server
Contains the R scripts that handle the computational backend of the application:
- Virtual population generation
- Pharmacokinetic (PK) of bedaquiline and bedaquiline's main metabolite M2 simulation and visualization
- Time-to-positivity (TTP) simulation and visualization
- QT interval simulation and visualization
- Long-term treatment outcome simulation and visualization
- Population summary statistics and visualization

### BDQ_UI
Contains the Shiny UI components and server logic:
- Main server script (`BDQ_Shiny_UI_Server.R`)
- UI modules for different sections of the application including:

  - User manual
  - Dosing interface
  - Individual or population characteristics and concomitant medication
  - Simulation configuration
  - Results visualization and output
  - Source code

## Features

- **1.  Dosing Selection**: Configure and select bedaquiline dosing regimens of interest
  - Add loading dose (optional)
  - Set maintenance dose parameters: dose amount, duration, frequency
  - Add second maintenance dose (optional)
  - Compare up to three different regimens simultaneously
  - Default regimen follows the approved bedaquiline dosing (400 mg daily for 2 weeks, followed by 200 mg thrice weekly for 22 weeks)

- **2.  Population Configuration**:
  - Choose between individual or population-level simulation
  - Individual mode: Set specific patient characteristics at baseline including age, weight, albumin concentration, calcium level, potassium level, TTP, sex, and race
  - Population mode:
      - Use default virtual population generated by using conditional distribution modelling [(Smania and Jonsson, *CPT:PSP*, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1002/psp4.12613)
        based on three clinical trials (two phase IIb trials [NCT01498419, NCT02193776] and one phase III trial [NCT02333799],
        data available in [the TB-PACTS platform](https://c-path.org/tools-platforms/tb-pacts/)), or
      - Import population data by users with specified columns needed
  - Specify patient treatment history (treatment-naÃ¯ve or treatment-experienced), depending on if they had received anti-TB therapy before initiating bedaquiline or not
  - Set half-life modifier to adjust the elimination rate of mycobacterial load
  - Add concomitant medications with drug-drug interaction effects:
    - PK effects: None, Efavirenz, Lopinavir/r, Nevirapine, Rifampicin, Rifapentine
    - QT effects: None, Clofazimine, Moxifloxacin, or both

- **3.  Simulation Settings**:
  - Specify number of individuals per regimen
  - Set number of MGIT culture replicates per sampling timepoint (1-3)
  - Configure simulation time for PK/efficacy/safety and long-term outcomes
  - Choose to simulate with or without interindividual variability

- **4.  Visualize and Output Results** 
  - Visualize PK profiles (full, daily average or weekly average concentrations) of bedaquiline and its metabolite M2
  - Predict proportions of negative cultures over time (from PK-efficacy model)
  - Predict QTcF interval over time
  - Predict long-term treatment outcomes over time
    - Individual trajectory in different states (outcomes) visualization in individual mode
    - Proportions of patients in each state (outcome) in population mode
  - Patient characteristics summary tables and graphs
  - Export simulation data for further analysis

## Usage

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/slove1200/**bdq-optimization-framework**.git
   ```

2. Install required R packages:
   ```R
   # Run this in R or RStudio
   install.packages(c("mrgsolve", "dplyr", "tidyr", "purrr", "zoo", "ggplot2", 
                     "shiny", "grid", "ggpubr", "DT", "bslib", "dipsaus",

   ```

### Running the Application
1. Open the script in RStudio:
   - Open RStudio
   - Select File > Open file
   - Navigate to the cloned repository and open the `BDQ_Shiny_UI_Server.R` file
