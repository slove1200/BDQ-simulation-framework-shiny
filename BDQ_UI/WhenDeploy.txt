1. Change app name into app.R
2. Make sure every file is under the deployed directory

e.g. app.R in one path, and then define
UI.directory <- "BDQ_UI/"
Server.directory <- "BDQ_Server/"

3. Server_Virtual_population.R

Change 
  orgCovsEx <- read.csv("//argos.storage.uu.se/MyFolder$/yujli183/PMxLab/Projects/BDQ shiny app optimization framework/ModelCodes/Virtual_population/Simulated_population_for_BDQ_virtural_population_WTALB.csv", 
                        header = T)

into 

  orgCovsEx <- read.csv("BDQ_Server/Simulated_population_for_BDQ_virtural_population_WTALB.csv", 
                        header = T)

and put the simulated dataset into the deployed directory/BDQ_Server

4. Deploy your app via the code:

rsconnect::deployApp("C:/Users/yujli183/Desktop/Deploy")
